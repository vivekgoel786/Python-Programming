Why QMM Over Platt Scaling?

✅ Preserves empirical default rates across different PD quantiles.
✅ Directly maps model PDs to real-world risk buckets, ensuring consistency.
✅ Works well when PDs need to be assigned to fixed rating categories (AAA, AA, A, etc.).
✅ More interpretable for credit risk teams, as it assigns borrowers to discrete risk groups.

When to Use QMM?

If the goal is to align PDs with a credit rating scale rather than just smoothing probabilities.

If historical default rates for each rating bucket (AAA, AA, A, etc.) are available.

When PD scores need to be classified into discrete risk levels instead of being left as continuous probabilities.

How QMM Works

1. Sort borrowers into quantiles based on their PD scores.


2. Assign each quantile to a predefined rating category (AAA, AA, A, etc.).


3. Calculate empirical default rates per quantile and adjust PDs accordingly.


4. Map adjusted PDs back to the master scale.
