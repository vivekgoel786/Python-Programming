Once the final weights were determined—balancing both statistical optimization and expert judgment—the model score for each customer was calculated independently for the Lombard Loan (LBL) and Property-Backed Loan (PBL) portfolios. The model score represents a weighted aggregation of the client's responses across all selected risk factors.

The score for each customer was computed using the following formula:

> Model Score = Σ (Final Weight of Each Factor × Factor Bucket Score Based on Client Response)



Each factor bucket score ranged from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the least risky profile and 0 indicating the highest risk. These scores were then weighted according to the finalized factor weights to produce a composite model score for each customer.

To assess the strength of alignment between the model-generated customer risk ranking and the BU-assigned risk ranking, the Kendall Tau (KT) rank correlation coefficient was computed. The results of this validation step were as follows:

LBL Portfolio: Kendall Tau = 54.52%

PBL Portfolio: Kendall Tau = 38.43%


These KT values reflect a moderate-to-strong level of alignment, especially considering the qualitative nature of the input data and the small portfolio size. The scores provided a stable and interpretable basis for risk ranking, setting the foundation for subsequent PD calibration to the bank’s master scale. correlation coefficient was computed. A higher Kendall Tau value indicated stronger alignment between the model output and expert judgment.

Each client’s model score was calculated as the weighted sum of the scores across all selected factors, where individual factor scores (ranging from 0 to 10) were multiplied by their respective optimized weights. Clients were then ranked based on these model scores, with higher scores indicating lower risk. The model's performance was then validated by comparing the resulting client ranks with BU-assigned ranks using Kendall Tau.

To ensure interpretability and consistency, two key constraints were enforced on the final weights:

1. The sum of all final factor weights across the model equals 100%.


2. The sum of the final weights of all factors within a risk dimension equals the total weight assigned to that dimension.



After statistical optimization, the final weights were subjected to manual review and adjustment by S&P and SCB stakeholders, ensuring the model incorporated business judgment and practical considerations not fully captured through quantitative analysis. This hybrid methodology ensured the final risk scoring framework was both statistically robust and operationally acceptable.
