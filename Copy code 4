Following the calibration process, the final Probability of Default (PD) for each customer was derived based on their assigned model score and the corresponding mapping to SCB’s internal Master Scale. This calibration was conducted independently for both the LBL and PBL portfolios, ensuring that the PDs reflected segment-specific risk characteristics and calibration logic. For the two customers who appeared in both portfolios, separate PDs were generated—one from the LBL model and another from the PBL model. In line with conservative risk management practices, the higher of the two PDs was assigned as the final PD for these customers. This approach ensured prudence in risk estimation and consistency with internal credit policy standards, especially in cases of multi-product exposure.
