Before initiating the calibration process, a Comparable Default Trend (CDT) analysis was jointly conducted by S&P in collaboration with the SCB Business Unit (BU) team, modeling team, and domain experts to determine an appropriate target average Probability of Default (PD) for both the Lombard Loan (LBL) and Property-Backed Loan (PBL) portfolios. This critical step aimed to ensure that the calibrated PDs align with industry benchmarks and reflect realistic portfolio-level risk expectations. The analysis leveraged exposure-weighted PD data from peer institutions—specifically JB and UBS—for comparable Lombard and Mortgage portfolios spanning the period from 2017 to 2024. After extensive deliberations and multiple rounds of discussion, a target average PD of 0.39% was mutually agreed upon.

Post calibration, the average PDs obtained were 0.40% for LBL and 0.394% for PBL, both of which are very close to the target and demonstrate a well-aligned calibration process. This reinforces the robustness of the model in capturing portfolio-level risk while staying anchored to business expectations and external benchmarks.
