Following the computation of model scores for each customer, the next critical step was to calibrate the model output to SCB’s internal Master Scale (MS)—a standardized credit rating scale ranging from MS1 to MS20, where each rating bucket corresponds to a defined Probability of Default (PD) range. The purpose of calibration is to align the model-derived scores with a quantifiable and interpretable PD measure that is consistent with the bank’s internal risk management framework and capital allocation methodologies. Calibration ensures that the model not only discriminates well between risk levels but also produces PD estimates that are aligned with regulatory expectations and internal benchmarks.

To achieve this, the continuous model score (ranging from 0 to 10) was segmented into discrete PD buckets that map to appropriate master scale ratings. The calibration process aimed to satisfy the following key conditions:

1. Average PD Alignment: The overall average PD for each portfolio should closely match the target Central Default Tendency (CDT), which was defined at 0.39%, based on benchmarking with peer institutions and historical data.


2. Rank Correlation Maximization: The calibration should maximize Kendall Tau rank correlation between the assigned MS rating and the BU-assigned customer ranking, thereby preserving alignment with business intuition.


3. Balanced Distribution (HHI): The Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) was used to assess the spread of customers across MS buckets. A lower HHI indicates better dispersion and avoids over-concentration in a few buckets, improving rating granularity and stability.


4. Monotonicity: The final calibration must maintain the principle that higher model scores correspond to lower PDs, i.e., less risky customers are assigned to better (lower-numbered) MS buckets.



Based on these criteria, the final calibrated structure consisted of six MS buckets (MS7 to MS12) for both portfolios. This range was chosen to reflect the narrow risk distribution typical of HNWI portfolios, while maintaining differentiation between customers.

Average Calibrated PD:\n

LBL Portfolio: 0.40%\n

PBL Portfolio: 0.394%


Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI):\n

LBL Portfolio: 23.5%\n

PBL Portfolio: 21.4%


Most Populated Bucket: For both portfolios, MS9 emerged as the modal bucket, reflecting a near-normal distribution of risk scores—appropriate given the overall conservative risk profile of the HNWI base.


This calibration process ensured that the model-generated PD estimates are not only statistically aligned with internal benchmarks but also operationally consistent with how risk is measured and managed within the bank.
