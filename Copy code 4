The Probability of Default (PD) models developed for the Lombard (LBL) and Mortgage (PBL) portfolios have multiple strategic and operational applications within SCB's risk management framework. These uses span credit decisioning, portfolio oversight, capital allocation, and risk-based client engagement, enabling a more data-driven and consistent risk culture across the business. The key uses of the models are outlined below:

7.1 Credit Risk Assessment

Client-Level Risk Evaluation: The calibrated PD scores serve as quantitative measures of credit risk at the individual client level. These help in evaluating a customer’s likelihood of default based on holistic information across qualitative and quantitative dimensions.

New-to-Bank Clients: For onboarding new clients, the models provide an early, structured risk view even when financial history is limited, using factors like relationship tenure, net worth, and behavioral proxies.

Reassessment of Existing Clients: The models facilitate periodic reassessment of client risk profiles, especially during reviews or material changes in financials, ensuring early identification of deterioration or improvement.


7.2 Risk-Based Pricing and Credit Limits

Risk-Adjusted Pricing: PD estimates can be integrated into pricing frameworks to align loan interest rates with client riskiness, ensuring a fair risk-return tradeoff.

Limit Setting and Exposure Management: PD scores can be used as inputs for setting or revising client-level and group-level credit limits. Clients with lower PDs may be eligible for higher exposure thresholds or product eligibility.


7.3 Portfolio Monitoring and Early Warning

Portfolio Risk Segmentation: The models enable segmentation of the portfolio into risk bands using calibrated PD buckets (e.g., MS7–MS12), allowing for targeted oversight of higher-risk segments.

Early Warning Signals: Clients exhibiting upward rating migration (i.e., worsening PDs) over time can be flagged for proactive review and engagement, reducing the likelihood of credit events.

Concentration Analysis: By assigning PDs consistently across the book, the models support analysis of risk concentrations by segment, geography, or RM book.


7.4 Capital Planning and Provisioning

Regulatory Alignment: Though currently non-regulatory, the models can be leveraged for Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) calculations or for preparing the portfolio for potential IRB transition.

Loan Loss Provisions: PD scores can be used to estimate Expected Credit Loss (ECL) under IFRS 9 frameworks, particularly in assigning Stage 1 and Stage 2 classifications for lifetime ECL modeling.


7.5 Strategic Decision Making

Risk-Adjusted Growth: The models support strategic growth by enabling selective onboarding of clients with favorable PDs while maintaining portfolio quality.

Product Development: Insights from score distributions and factor-level importance can guide the development or tailoring of financial products to suit varying client risk appetites.


7.6 Internal Risk Governance

Alignment with BU Judgments: The strong Kendall Tau correlations between model scores and Business Unit (BU) assigned risk ranks help reinforce confidence among stakeholders, promoting consistency in risk language and culture.

Performance Monitoring: Regular tracking of model outputs, average PDs, and transition matrices supports model performance reviews and audit readiness.


7.7 Business Planning and Reporting

MIS & Reporting: PD model outputs can be integrated into risk dashboards and Management Information Systems (MIS) for monthly or quarterly reporting at client, RM, or portfolio level.

Stress Testing Scenarios: The models can be extended for scenario analysis, enabling management to simulate the impact of macroeconomic shocks or adverse events on portfolio risk.
