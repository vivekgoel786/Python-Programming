6. Model Validation

6.1 Summary of Model Validation Results

Following the finalization of the model, a comprehensive validation process was conducted to evaluate the performance, stability, and robustness of the model. The validation included in-time (development) testing, out-of-time (OOT) testing, backtesting, benchmarking against internal ratings, sensitivity and scenario testing, and key metric evaluations.

6.2 Performance Testing

6.2.1 Backtesting

6.2.1.1 In-Time Validation

The model's in-time validation demonstrated strong discriminatory power, alignment with RM-assigned risk ranks, and good calibration with a target average PD of 0.39%. The development sample included 27 customers for LBL and 48 for PBL, with 2 overlapping customers. The model showed good distribution spread across 6 Master Scale buckets for both portfolios and high Kendall Tau correlations with BU risk rankings—46.2% for PBL and 61% for LBL. HHI values of 21.4% (PBL) and 23.5% (LBL) indicated healthy distribution diversity. Accuracy ratios and other relevant statistics were also found to be satisfactory.

6.2.1.2 Out-of-Time (OOT) Validation

After the model was finalized, an OOT validation exercise was undertaken to assess stability and predictive power using updated data as of March 2025. A similar questionnaire-based data collection process was deployed. The RM team was provided with pre-filled responses for qualitative factors (e.g., personality risk, investment style, diversification), which remained largely unchanged. Time-dependent fields like age, lending relationship, and investing relationship were incremented by one year by SCB prior to RM engagement.

RMs were asked to update more volatile quantitative data (e.g., master limit, net worth, AUM, DSCR, KWR). Post-submission, S&P performed a thorough data cleaning and formatting to ensure consistency with the development data. A total of 26 LBL and 44 PBL customers were included in the OOT sample, with 3 customers overlapping between the two portfolios.

OOT model scores were computed using the original factor weights and bucket scores. The calibrated model scores were then mapped to MS ratings and PDs. Key performance metrics were evaluated to assess rating stability and model robustness.

PBL OOT Results:

PSI: 0.042, indicating no significant shift.

Average PD: 0.41%, close to development average of 0.394%.

Kendall Tau (BU vs. OOT): 40.5%, vs. 46.2% in development.

HHI: 21.1%, vs. 21.4% in development.

KT (OOT vs. Development MS rating): 57.1%.

Rating movements: 15 upgraded, 11 downgraded, 18 unchanged.

Spread: Ratings remained across 6 buckets, indicating stable distribution.


LBL OOT Results:

PSI: 0.363, indicating a significant shift in rating distribution.

Average PD: 0.40%, same as in development.

Kendall Tau (BU vs. OOT): 65.5%, improved from 61% in development.

HHI: 20.4%, vs. 23.5% in development.

KT (OOT vs. Development MS rating): 85.2%.

Rating movements: 5 upgraded, 7 downgraded, 13 unchanged.

Spread: Distribution reduced to 5 buckets (no customers in MS12).


6.2.2 Benchmarking

The OOT ratings were benchmarked against SCB’s internal BU ratings to evaluate the model’s ability to rank-order risk. Kendall Tau correlation and notch movement analysis were key benchmarking measures. In both portfolios, the model continued to display meaningful alignment with internal expectations.

6.3 Sensitivity and Scenario Testing

To test the impact of specific variables on model behavior, a sensitivity check was conducted for the LBL_PBL_RELATIONSHIP factor within the PBL portfolio. Using OOT data, this factor was replaced with its values from the development dataset, while all other factor values were retained from OOT.

PSI (vs. Development): 0.076

PSI (vs. OOT): 0.039


These results indicate no significant impact of this factor on the model's predictive power or calibration, confirming robustness.

Additionally, an analysis was conducted to understand the primary drivers behind the shift observed in the LBL portfolio. By calculating PSI values for individual factors, the following were identified as key contributors:

AUM (excluding loan proceeds): PSI = 0.72

KWR: PSI = 0.33

LBL_PBL_RELATIONSHIP: PSI = 0.27


The significant change in AUM values, in particular, was indicative of broader market-driven shifts that impacted portfolio characteristics.

6.4 Robustness and Stability Testing

The following metrics were computed to evaluate model stability and robustness over time:

1. Population Stability Index (PSI)


2. Transition Matrices


3. Upgrade/Downgrade Analysis


4. Rating Distribution


5. Average PD


6. Kendall Tau (OOT vs. BU Ratings)


7. Kendall Tau (OOT vs. Development Ratings)


8. Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI)


9. Accuracy Ratio



Despite the LBL portfolio exhibiting significant shifts in the rating distribution (PSI > 0.25), the model’s performance remains robust and aligned with internal benchmarks. The PBL portfolio continued to show strong performance with minimal shifts and high alignment to development metrics.

The model is successful in identifying shifts in client risk, as evidenced by changes in MS ratings and model scores, while maintaining overall stability. The results affirm the model’s capability to remain valid over time and across datasets.

6.5 Model Adjustments

No structural model adjustments were deemed necessary following the OOT validation. However, the performance shift in the LBL portfolio is acknowledged and monitored. Detailed factor-level insights and sensitivity checks justify the observed behavior and will inform future model review cycles.
