After completing the Single Factor Analysis (SFA) and finalizing the list of relevant variables, each selected variable was carefully bucketed to ensure clear risk differentiation across its range of values. The objective was to translate qualitative and quantitative risk signals into a consistent and interpretable scoring framework. Each bucket within a factor was evaluated based on its associated risk level, supported by the default rate analysis and business judgment, and then assigned a score on a scale from 0 to 10—where 10 represents the least risky bucket and 0 indicates the riskiest.

This scoring scale was consistently applied across all factors to allow comparability and meaningful aggregation of risk scores across dimensions. For example, in the case of the Age variable, the bucket “50–60” was considered the least risky based on historical and expert inputs and hence assigned a score of 10, whereas the buckets “<30” and “≥75” were considered higher risk and assigned a score of 0. Similar scoring logic was applied to each bucket of other variables, with adjustments made based on statistical findings and expert validation.

This structured scoring methodology ensured that each variable contributed proportionately to the overall risk assessment, based not only on empirical evidence but also on sound business rationale. The scoring served as a foundation for computing the weighted model score used for ranking and PD calibration.
