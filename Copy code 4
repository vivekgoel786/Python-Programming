there are random numbers in sheet 1 column B -> 1,2,2.5,3,4,4.4,5,6,6.8,7,8,9.9....
then in sheet 2 there is a column G -> 10,8,6,4,2 and H->8,6,4,2,0 and for each value in columns G and H there is a value in column B ->MS-i, MS-ii, MS-iii, MS-iv....

we want to fill column C in sheet 1, corresponding to column B such that it checks each value of column B in range of G and H to see if that value falls in that bucket and pick the corresponding value in column B of sheet 2
