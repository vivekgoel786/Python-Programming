Given the small portfolio size, the absence of historical default data, and the qualitative nature of available information, a scorecard-based model framework was selected as the most appropriate approach for estimating Probability of Default (PD) for the HNWI Lombard Loan (LBL) and Property-Backed Loan (PBL) portfolios.

The final model design is a weighted additive scorecard, where each customer is assigned a risk score based on the weighted combination of scores across multiple risk factors. The model specification was driven by several key considerations:

Data Constraints: The limited number of customers (n = 73) and lack of actual default observations made traditional statistical or machine learning models unsuitable. Instead, a structured scorecard model allowed for robust risk differentiation using expert-validated factors and scores.

Expert-Driven Inputs: The model integrates relationship manager (RM) insights, structured through a detailed 43-question survey, and further validated through extensive discussions with SCB’s business and modeling teams.

Model Composition: The PBL model incorporates 15 risk factors across 7 risk dimensions, while the LBL model includes 16 factors across 6 dimensions. Buckets for each factor were defined through a combination of statistical analysis and expert judgment. Scores were assigned to each bucket on a consistent risk scale ranging from 0 (most risky) to 10 (least risky). Factor weighting was initially guided by stakeholder input, then optimized statistically to maximize alignment with RM-assigned rankings using Kendall Tau correlation. The final models achieve a strong balance between statistical rigor and practical interpretability.

Segmentation: Two separate models were developed for the LBL and PBL portfolios to reflect portfolio-specific characteristics, data availability, and business nuances. Independent model scores and calibrations were carried out for each segment.

Interpretability and Transparency: The scorecard model provides high interpretability, allowing SCB stakeholders to clearly understand how each customer’s profile contributes to their overall risk score. This is particularly important for regulatory validation, business acceptance, and ongoing governance.

Calibration to Internal Master Scale: The final model scores were calibrated to SCB’s internal 20-point Master Scale, translating model outputs into PDs. Calibration targeted specific criteria such as matching the average target PD, maximizing correlation with RM ratings, achieving a well-spread distribution (low concentration), and ensuring monotonicity (i.e., higher scores reflect lower risk).


This scorecard-based specification was chosen after assessing various modeling options and was deemed most appropriate in balancing the business context, data limitations, transparency needs, and risk differentiation objectives.
