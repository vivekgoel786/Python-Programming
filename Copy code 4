After the data collection phase, wherein the Relationship Managers (RMs) completed a 43-question risk profiling questionnaire, S&P undertook a comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing exercise to ensure the dataset was suitable for further analysis and modeling. This process included identifying and correcting input errors, inspecting variable distributions, standardizing data formats, detecting and handling outliers and missing values, and validating the accuracy and consistency of responses. The refined data was then transformed into a structured tabular format compatible with Python-based analytical tools for downstream processing.

Following data refinement, a detailed Single Factor Analysis (SFA) was conducted to evaluate the strength and suitability of each risk factor for inclusion in the model. For numerical variables, appropriate bucketing was applied to group responses into meaningful categories. For categorical variables, categories were combined based on frequency distributions to ensure statistical robustness. For each bucket within every factor, the number of proxy defaults (“bads”) was analyzed, and the corresponding default rate was computed. Visual bar plots were generated for each variable to display the bucket-wise default rate (illustrated with an orange line) and the expected theoretical relationship between the variable and risk (shown as a green dashed line). These visualizations facilitated a clearer understanding of each factor’s discriminatory behavior.

To further assess variable quality, several key metrics were calculated:\n

1. Correlation with BU-Assigned Ranking – a higher correlation indicates stronger alignment with business judgment and is preferred.\n


2. Accuracy Ratio (AR) – a measure of a variable’s discriminatory power; higher AR values suggest better ability to separate high- and low-risk clients.\n


3. Relative Information Entropy (RIE) – used to evaluate the concentration of responses within the variable; higher entropy indicates a more informative variable with better distributional balance.



The SFA results were discussed extensively with the SCB business and modeling teams, incorporating their qualitative insights and domain knowledge. Based on stakeholder feedback, S&P iteratively re-bucketed several variables and recalculated key metrics to assess pre- and post-feedback performance improvements. This helped refine the selection of variables not just on statistical grounds but also with due consideration to business relevance and interpretability.

It is important to note that some variables were excluded outright from further consideration due to reasons such as low correlation with BU rankings, high concentration in a single bucket (i.e., low RIE), high levels of missing data, or redundancy with other better-performing factors within the same risk dimension.


It is important to note that some variables were excluded outright from further consideration due to one or more of the following reasons: low correlation with BU rankings, high concentration in a single bucket (i.e., low Relative Information Entropy), significant levels of missing or inconsistent data, redundancy with other higher-performing factors within the same risk dimension, or practical limitations in future data availability. Specifically, certain variables—such as margin call history or the Key Wealth Ratio (KWR) with other banks—were deemed unsuitable because such information may not be reliably available or observable for newly onboarded clients. Including such variables could compromise the scalability and operational usability of the model, especially when applied in real-time decision-making or for prospective clients.
