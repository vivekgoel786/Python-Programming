The final model was selected through a rigorous, collaborative process combining statistical analysis, expert input, and iterative business feedback. The objective was to develop a robust, interpretable, and practical credit risk scoring framework for both the Lombard (LBL) and Mortgage (PBL) portfolios.

The PBL model comprises 15 risk factors across 7 risk dimensions, while the LBL model includes 16 factors across 6 dimensions. These factors were shortlisted not only based on their statistical strength—measured using metrics such as correlation with BU ranks, accuracy ratio, and information entropy—but also based on their business relevance, availability of information, and interpretability by Relationship Managers (RMs) and credit stakeholders.

Each factor was bucketed using statistical analysis and expert judgment, followed by score assignment on a 0–10 risk scale, where 10 represents the least risky and 0 the riskiest category. This scoring approach ensures intuitive understanding while capturing meaningful risk differentiation.

Factor weights were estimated via a two-step approach:

1. Stakeholder ranking of dimensions and factors to reflect perceived importance.


2. Statistical optimization to maximize the Kendall Tau correlation between model-derived risk ranks and RM-assigned BU ranks.



The resulting models showed strong alignment with internal expert judgment while maintaining desirable statistical properties. A successful calibration to SCB’s internal Master Scale further validated the model. The calibration ensured that:

The average PD of the final distribution for LBL and PBL were 0.40% and 0.394%, respectively—very close to the agreed target PD of 0.39%.

Higher model scores corresponded to lower PDs, in line with risk logic.

The customer distribution was well spread, as shown by healthy HHI values (23.5% for LBL, 21.4% for PBL).

The Kendall Tau correlation between model score ranks and BU ranks was maintained at high levels to ensure interpretability and consistency.


In conclusion, the final model strikes a balanced integration of statistical rigor, expert insight, and business applicability. It provides a transparent and defendable framework for risk ranking and monitoring, and sets a strong foundation for future credit risk management, portfolio segmentation, and strategy development.
