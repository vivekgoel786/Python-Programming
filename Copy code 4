Following the bucketing and scoring of individual factors, the next critical step was to determine the relative importance—or weights—of each factor in contributing to the overall risk profile of a customer. To achieve this, S&P adopted a structured and iterative approach that combined expert-driven inputs with statistical optimization.

Initially, stakeholders were asked to rank the risk dimensions and the individual factors within each dimension based on their perceived importance in assessing customer creditworthiness. These inputs captured business intuition and domain expertise, which were essential in the absence of traditional model training data.

Using these rankings as a foundation, S&P performed a statistical optimization to determine the final weights assigned to each factor and dimension. The optimization aimed to improve the agreement between the model-generated customer risk ranks and the Business Unit (BU)-assigned risk ranks. To evaluate the quality of this alignment, the Kendall Tau rank correlation coefficient was computed. A higher Kendall Tau value indicated stronger alignment between the model output and expert judgment.

Each client’s model score was calculated as the weighted sum of the scores across all selected factors, where individual factor scores (ranging from 0 to 10) were multiplied by their respective optimized weights. Clients were then ranked based on these model scores, with higher scores indicating lower risk. The model's performance was then validated by comparing the resulting client ranks with BU-assigned ranks using Kendall Tau.

To ensure interpretability and consistency, two key constraints were enforced on the final weights:

1. The sum of all final factor weights across the model equals 100%.


2. The sum of the final weights of all factors within a risk dimension equals the total weight assigned to that dimension.



After statistical optimization, the final weights were subjected to manual review and adjustment by S&P and SCB stakeholders, ensuring the model incorporated business judgment and practical considerations not fully captured through quantitative analysis. This hybrid methodology ensured the final risk scoring framework was both statistically robust and operationally acceptable.
