As mentioned in my previous chats. I was involved in development of HNWI PD model for property backed and lombard loan portfolios.
We have created the models for both portfolios individually. We have also calibrarted the model to the master scale.
Few facts:

1. Small portfolio of 73 customers in total for both LBL and PBL


2. 27 customers in LBL and 48 customers in PBL. 2 customers has presence in both.


3. Preparing dependent variable - As there were no defaults in the dataset. We asked the RMs to rank the customers based on their risk profile. Ranking as A, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1,D2, E
D2 and E being the riskiest. We considered customers falling in D2 and E as proxy defaults. So 10 out of 73 custmoers were considered as proxy defaults.


4. SFA was conducted on each variable factor - finding correlations, generating new variables, creating the dependent variable from BU assigned ranking to the customers, bucketing each variable from diverse responses from RM in the questionnare.


5. Bucketing of each factor things we kept in mind - good correlation with BU ranking, good discriminatory power from Accuracy ratio, good relative information entropy which checks the concentration in the distribution of the variable. Also it should make business sense that high risk bucket should possibly have high default rate. There were also a couple of factors that were selected for model which did not perform well in sfa but were important for the model. So stakeholders decided to keep them.


6. When relevant factors were selected. Each factor has factor dimension for it.
Credit history and reputation - length of relationship LBL and PBL lending, investing relationship with bank, payment history
Wealth parameters and income - Net worth, Aum excluding loan proceed, aum buffer ratio, income source as Salary, DSCR, AVG MR, KWR
Legal risk - Legal risk compliance client
Financial stability and liquidity  - Diversification of the assets owned
Personality - Suitability Test Risk Score, Personality Riskiness/ Stability, Investment style
Customer Background - Age
Collateral Quality - Collateral quality of major properties pledged


7. Most of the factors were used iN Both LBL and PBL BUT THERE were some exceptions.
"Collateral quality of major properties pledged" this factor was only avalible for pbl and not for LBL
" Dscr" and " Avg Mr" was only available for LBL and not for PBL


8. So we got 15 factors for PBL with 7 factor Dimensions
16 factors for LBL with 6 factor dimensions


9. After bucketing of each factor, scores were assigned to each bucket of the factor from 0 to 10, 0 being the riskiest and 10 is least risky.


10. We we assigned weights for each factor.
We asked stakeholders to rank each dimension and factor within on the basis of importance, then we statistically optimised the dimension weights and factor weights to arrive at final weight for each factor. We used kendall tau to evaulate the goodness of the optimization. We multiplied the final weights of each factor with factor resonses score of each client, got the model score, risk rank the clients based on the model score. Higher the score lower the risk. Then kendall tau was calculated between the risk rank and BU assigned rank. Higher the kendall tau better it the optimization. The final weights were then Manually adjusted based on expert judgements.



11.after getting the final factors, final weights of each factor and scores for each bucket in all factors. We calculates the model score for each customer.

12. Now when we had model score for each client we had to calibrate the model to the master scale provided by the bank.
There has been multiple rounds of discussion with the client regarding CDT value for avg PD and we decided for 0.39%. References were taken from past data of other internaltional banks like UBS and JB to arrive at 0.39%.
The calibration was done keeping CDT in mind as well as the buckets of pd scores were manually calibrated in a such a way that HHI is good and we can attain the avg PD of both LBL and pbl protfolio slightly above the CDT value.
Higher the score lower is the PD.



Now we need to elaborate each step and prepare the documentation of the pD model for the bank.
We need to fill sections and sub sections in the documentation, these are -
3. OVERALL METHODOLOGY
3.1.model flow diagram
3.2 model Theory
3.3 methodology selection
3 4 methology assumptions and limitations

4. Model inputss
4.1 data source and processing overview
4.2 data inputs definitions
4.3 data analysis
4.4 model development data
4.5 data treatment and transformations
4.6 data input assumptions and limitations


5. Model development
5.1 moe development process
5.2 segmentation/grouping
5.3 model scecification and selection
5.4 model estimations and calibration
5.4.1 model parameters estimation
5.4.2 final model calibration
5.5 final model selection



Based on the details i told, can you help me document all the details in this format in formal english.
There could be some places where some details could be missing but you can suggest what to write in them, i will take care of it
