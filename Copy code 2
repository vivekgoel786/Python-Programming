Blending
Instead of using static scenario weights, the PIT LGD framework leverages predicted probabilities from the Ordered Logit Model (OLM) to weight each scenario dynamically. For every forecast quarter, the OLM generates probabilities of the economy being in Poor, Normal, or Good states. These probabilities are then used as blending weights to combine scenario-level PIT LGD estimates. This ensures that the final PIT LGD is fully consistent with the macro modelâ€™s forward-looking view, and automatically adapts to changing economic outlooks without relying on arbitrary fixed weights.
