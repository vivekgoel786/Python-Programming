Subject: OOT Validation Results for PD Model – Analysis and PSI Observations

Dear [Client's Name],

As discussed in our previous meeting, please find attached the detailed analysis of the Out-of-Time (OOT) validation conducted for the PD model across both Lombard and Property-Backed Loan (PBL) portfolios.

We performed the Population Stability Index (PSI) test to assess the stability of the model inputs over time:

The model continues to perform well on the PBL portfolio, with PSI values within acceptable thresholds.

However, for the Lombard portfolio, we observed a significant shift in data distribution, with PSI exceeding 0.35.


Despite this shift, the model’s performance remains robust. Upon investigation, the shift in the Lombard portfolio is primarily attributed to the following factors:

AUM excluding loan proceeds

AUM buffer ratio

KWR (Key Wealth Ratio)

LBL_PBL_relationship


You can refer to the "LBL REASONING" sheet in the attached file for a detailed breakdown of the PSI contributions from these variables.

Please feel free to reach out in case you'd like to discuss the insights or next steps in more detail.
