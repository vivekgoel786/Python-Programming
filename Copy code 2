Slide 1: Title Slide

Quasi Moment Matching (QMM)
Calibration Technique for PD Models in Low Default Portfolios


---

Slide 2: What is Quasi Moment Matching?

QMM is a calibration technique that adjusts PD estimates to match target default rates and distributional moments (mean, variance).

Commonly used in low-default portfolios (LDPs) where historical defaults are scarce.

Ensures realistic, smooth, and monotonic PD curves while maintaining ranking of credit risk grades.



---

Slide 3: Uses of QMM

PD Calibration in Low Default Portfolios (LDP)
Adjusts PDs for high-rated corporates, sovereigns, and project finance.

Regulatory Compliance
Meets Basel II/III requirements by aligning PD estimates with long-term expectations.

IFRS 9 / ECL Models
Supports lifetime PD estimation when defaults are rare.

Mapping TTC → PIT PDs
Converts long-term through-the-cycle PDs to point-in-time PDs reflecting current conditions.

Stress Testing
Adjust PDs for stressed scenarios in capital planning.

Rating System Calibration
Ensures each rating grade aligns with benchmarks (internal/external).



---

Slide 4: Why QMM is Useful

Avoids zero PD problem in low default portfolios.

Aligns model outputs with target portfolio default rates.

Combines statistical rigor and expert judgment.

Maintains discriminatory power among rating grades.



---

Slide 5: Benefits of QMM

Works with very low or zero historical defaults.

Ensures regulatory compliance (Basel II/III, IFRS 9).

Produces smooth and monotonic PD curves.

Allows consistency across portfolios and over time.

Supports flexible calibration (match mean PD or variance as well).



---

Slide 6: Limitations of QMM

Sensitive to target PD inputs — wrong target distorts results.

Assumes logit-normal distribution of PDs.

Requires numerical optimization and careful initialization.

Poor implementation may flatten differences between rating grades (loss of discrimination).

Perceived as a black-box technique by stakeholders.

Slide 7: How QMM Works

1. Define target portfolio default rate (mean) and optionally variance.


2. Compute empirical PDs for each rating grade.


3. Apply logistic transformation:



PD_{i}^{\text{cal}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\alpha + \beta \cdot \ln(PD_{i}^{\text{emp}}))}}

5. Calibrated PDs replace empirical PDs for model and reporting use.

Slide 8: Mathematical Formulas

Step 1: Logistic Transformation of Empirical PDs

PD_i^{cal} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp\big(-(\alpha + \beta \cdot \ln(PD_i^{emp}))\big)}

Step 2: Match Portfolio Mean (1st Moment)

\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N PD_i^{cal} = PD_{\text{target}}

Step 3: Optionally Match Variance (2nd Moment)

\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (PD_i^{cal} - PD_{\text{target}})^2 = \text{Var}_{\text{target}}

Step 4: Optimization

Minimize loss function:


\text{Loss} = (\text{Mean}_{cal} - PD_{\text{target}})^2 + \lambda \cdot (\text{Var}_{cal} - \text{Var}_{target})^2

Slide 9: Sample Python Code

import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import minimize

# Example target default rate and empirical PDs
target_pd = 0.01
empirical_pds = np.array([0.002, 0.005, 0.01, 0.02])

# Loss function to minimize
def qmm_loss(params):
    alpha, beta = params
    calibrated = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(alpha + beta * np.log(empirical_pds))))
    mean_loss = (np.mean(calibrated) - target_pd) ** 2
    return mean_loss

# Optimization
res = minimize(qmm_loss, [0.1, 0.1])
alpha_opt, beta_opt = res.x
calibrated_pds = 1 / (1 + np.exp(-(alpha_opt + beta_opt * np.log(empirical_pds))))

print("Optimized alpha, beta:", alpha_opt, beta_opt)
print("Calibrated PDs:", calibrated_pds)

Slide 10: Visual Illustration (Concept)

Before QMM:

Raw empirical PDs for low-default grades: [0.0, 0.0, 0.01, 0.02]

PD curve is flat at zero → unrealistic


After QMM:

Calibrated PDs: [0.002, 0.005, 0.009, 0.015]

Smooth, monotonic curve that aligns with target portfolio PD


Visual Concept:

Slide 11: Key Takeaways

QMM is essential for low-default portfolios.

Balances statistical rigor with regulatory expectations.

Produces smooth, monotonic PD curves while avoiding zero-PD problems.

Requires careful selection of target PDs and optimization settings.

Works well in TTC → PIT conversions, stress testing, IFRS 9 calibration, and regulatory reporting.
