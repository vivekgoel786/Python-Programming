Although conventional statistical validation or back-testing was not applicable in this context due to the nature of the haircut model, a comprehensive benchmarking and review process was undertaken to ensure robustness and appropriateness of the recommended haircuts. Haircuts were derived based on an extensive analysis of available data across a wide range of asset and sub-asset classes. The data used for this exercise was sourced both from the client and publicly available free sources.

To validate the reasonableness of the recommended haircuts, a detailed benchmarking exercise was carried out. This involved comparing our recommendations against industry standards, available market references, and expert judgment. Several rounds of discussions were held between our modelling team, the clientâ€™s market risk team, and their modelling team to assess and refine the haircut levels. These discussions helped incorporate both internal analysis and market perspectives, leading to a set of haircut values that reflect a conservative stance suitable for downstream LGD estimation.

The finalised haircuts represent a blend of data-driven insights, expert judgment from both our team and the client's domain experts, and practical experience from international markets. This collaborative and iterative process served as a key form of model validation, ensuring the outputs are both risk-sensitive and aligned with prudent credit risk management practices.
