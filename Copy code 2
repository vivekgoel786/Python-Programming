Among the cases analyzed, 12 customers had a "less than 1 year" lending relationship in the 2024 data. Upon recalculating their model scores and corresponding ratings under the adjusted inputs:

•	Most of them(8 customers) retained the same rating as before.

•	Only 4 customers showed an improvement in their rating by 1 notch.

For the 4 customers that have migrated had the final score around the threshold between successive ratings, hence small changes in the score had an impact. This indicates that increased lending tenure alone does not have a significant or consistent influence on the model rating. This outcome is aligned with the design of the scorecard. To summarize, while longer client relationships may add incremental confidence from a business perspective, their isolated impact on the scorecard output is limited, reflecting the factor's calibrated role in the overall risk assessment framework.
