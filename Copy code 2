Given the absence of defaults in the HNWI Lombard portfolio, traditional statistical backtesting approaches could not be applied to the PIT LGD model. Instead, the focus of robustness and stability testing was on evaluating the behavior of LGD outputs across time to ensure that the model produces consistent and interpretable results.

A key evaluation criterion was to confirm that there are no cliff effects or sudden jumps in LGD values from one quarter to the next. Such discontinuities would undermine the reliability of PIT LGDs for risk management and capital planning. To address this, two methodological safeguards were embedded into the framework:

Blending: Scenario outputs were combined using probabilities derived from the macro model, ensuring that LGD results reflect smooth transitions across economic conditions rather than abrupt shifts.

Smoothening: An Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) was applied to further filter out quarter-on-quarter volatility, preserving structural changes while reducing short-term noise.


The resulting PIT LGD time series demonstrated gradual and stable movements over the full historical horizon (2007Q2â€“2024Q1), while still capturing increases during stressed macroeconomic periods (e.g., Global Financial Crisis, COVID-19). This confirms that the model outputs are both robust to noise and stable for long-term use in IFRS 9 provisioning and internal risk management.
