1. Data Construction

You’re manually defining lists of economic and financial variables for Thailand across multiple quarters — from Mar 2006 to Mar 2024.
These include:
Macro indicators: GDP, GDPGR (GDP growth rate), CPI (inflation), UNEMP_RATE, AVG_MONTHLY_WAGE, MLR (minimum lending rate)
Consumption and investment data: PVT_CONSUMPTION, FII (foreign investment inflows), MV_SALES (motor vehicle sales)
External economic data: THAI_GDP (GDP growth of Thailand)
Categorical state: Economy_State_dummy (Good, Normal, Poor)
You combine them all into a pandas DataFrame called data.


2. Data Transformations
You perform mathematical and statistical transformations on all numerical variables to prepare them for modeling or analysis.
a. Square Root Transformation
You create new columns like sqrt_GDP, sqrt_CPI, etc.
→ Useful to stabilize variance and reduce skewness.

b. Log Transformation
You create log_* versions for all variables.
→ Common in econometrics to linearize exponential growth relationships.
(⚠️ Note: You’re taking np.log() of some values that might be negative — that would result in NaNs or errors. You may want to handle those with np.where(x>0, np.log(x), np.nan).)

c. Percentage Changes
You calculate both:
Quarter-on-Quarter (%QoQ) → data['q_pct_change_*'] = .pct_change()
Year-on-Year (%YoY) → data['pct_change_*'] = .pct_change(periods=4)
→ These show short-term and annualized growth rates for each variable.

d. Log Differences
log_diff_* = log(x) - log(x.shift(1))
→ Approximates the growth rate of each variable (often more stable than percentage change).

e. Moving Averages
You compute 2-, 3-, and 4-quarter moving averages for each variable.
→ These smooth out short-term volatility and help detect trends.

📅 3. Convert and Sort by Date
data['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Date'], format='%b-%y')
data = data.sort_values('Date').reset_index(drop=True)

⏳ 4. Lag and Lead Variables Creation

You create lag (past) and lead (future) versions for every variable:

data[f'{var}_lag1'] = data[var].shift(1)  # 1 quarter before
...
data[f'{var}_lead1'] = data[var].shift(-1) # 1 quarter ahead


→ This gives you a dataset where each row has access to previous and future values of all indicators — ideal for predictive modeling, causality testing, or feature engineering.

You also separate these into:

data_lags1, data_lags2, data_lags3, data_lags4

data_leads1, data_leads2, data_leads3, data_leads4

Each holds the variables shifted by 1–4 quarters.

🧱 5. Creating Master Feature Sets

You then construct two large DataFrames:

🧩 all_independent_variables_df

Contains only independent (numerical) features, combining:

the base data (excluding Date & Economy_State_dummy)

all lagged and lead versions of the same variables

➡️ Shape roughly:
[#rows, (#features × (1 original + 4 lags + 4 leads))]

Used for machine learning model inputs.

🧾 all_variables_df

Similar to above, but includes the main Date and Economy_State_dummy columns
→ Full dataset with all lagged and lead variables, preserving temporal context.
→ Ensures your dataset is chronologically ordered (important for lags/leads).





correlation_matrix = all_independent_variables_df.corr()
print(correlation_matrix)
This calculates and prints the correlation matrix for all independent variables in your dataset (all_independent_variables_df).
It helps identify how strongly variables are linearly related to one another.




⚙️ Part 2: Fitting Ordered Logit Models
The main function is:
fit_ordered_logit_models(data, target='Economy_State_dummy')
Purpose:
To fit separate ordered logistic regression models (one for each independent variable) to predict an ordered categorical dependent variable (like "Poor", "Normal", "Good").

🔍 Step-by-Step Breakdown

1.Set up the target variable
ordered_categories = ['Poor', 'Normal', 'Good']
data[target] = pd.Categorical(data[target], categories=ordered_categories, ordered=True)

Converts the dependent variable (Economy_State_dummy) into an ordered categorical variable.

2. Identify independent variables
    exclude_cols = ['Date', target]
    independent_vars = [col for col in data.columns if col not in exclude_cols]

Excludes Date and the target variable from the list of predictors.
Everything else is treated as a potential independent variable.

3. Loop through each independent variable
For each variable:
    It keeps only that variable and the target.
    Drops missing values.
    Fits an ordered logit model (via statsmodels.miscmodels.ordinal_model.OrderedModel) using:
        model = OrderedModel(y, X, distr='logit')
        res = model.fit(method='lbfgs', disp=False)


4.Extract results
For each fitted model:
It collects:
    Variable name
    Coefficients (including threshold parameters)
    P-values
    T-statistics
    Model fit statistics (AIC, BIC, Log-Likelihood, Number of observations)
    Pseudo R² (if available)
Each result is stored as a dictionary in a list.

5. Handle failed models
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Model failed for variable {var}: {e}")
If the model can’t be fit (due to missing data or convergence issues), it prints an error message but continues with the rest.

6. Return results
return pd.DataFrame(results_list)
Converts the list of results into a DataFrame for easy viewing and export.

🧾 Final Output
results_df = fit_ordered_logit_models(all_variables_df, target='Economy_State_dummy')
print(results_df)

Runs the function on your full dataset (all_variables_df).
Returns and prints a summary DataFrame containing all model statistics for each independent variable.

🧠 In Short
This script:
Checks correlations between independent variables.
Fits individual ordered logistic regressions for each variable predicting the economic state (Poor, Normal, Good).
Collects and summarizes model performance metrics and parameter estimates into a single, tidy table.
