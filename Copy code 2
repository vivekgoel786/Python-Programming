After finalizing the model development, calibration (MS7 to MS12), and overlay warning signals, an important business question was raised:
Should loan applications be automatically approved for all customers falling within MS12, or should a minimum model score threshold be applied to reject high-risk cases?

To address this, Standard Chartered Bank (SCB) conducted a detailed mock-up case analysis for both PBL (Property-Backed Lending) and LBL (Lombard-Backed Lending) portfolios. The objective was to identify the lowest feasible model score observed among potential customers and establish a threshold cut-off for rejection.

Key Findings from Mock-Up Case Analysis

A comprehensive review of customer-level cases revealed that the minimum observed model score was 1.

Based on this, a new rejection bucket, MS13, was created.

The model score ranges were updated as follows:

MS13: 0 to 1 (Rejection Category)

MS12: >1 to 4 (Acceptable Risk Category, subject to other criteria)



Implementation of Rejection Rule

Any customer with a model score â‰¤ 1 will automatically be assigned an MS13 rating.

Applications falling in MS13 will be rejected without further credit approval, ensuring that extremely high-risk customers do not enter the portfolio.

This threshold serves as a minimum entry safeguard, complementing the calibrated model scores and expert-judgment overlays.
