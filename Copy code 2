1. Executive Summary

1.1 Model Purpose(s) and Use(s)

The purpose of the IFRS9 LGD model is to generate Point-in-Time (PIT) Loss Given Default (LGD) estimates for performing exposures in compliance with IFRS9 Expected Credit Loss (ECL) requirements.
Since the portfolio lacks sufficient default history, a Macro Model was developed as a core component to capture the impact of forward-looking macroeconomic conditions on LGD. The Macro Model forecasts the economy type (Poor, Normal, Good) on a quarterly basis using macroeconomic variables (MEVs). The economy state is then mapped to liquidity horizons and integrated with the IRB Performing LGD framework to produce PIT LGD estimates under different macro scenarios.

1.2 Model Description

Macro Model: Ordered Logit Model predicts quarterly economy state (Poor, Normal, Good) using MEVs (GDP, unemployment, CPI, wages, etc.).

Macro Tagging: Historical quarters tagged into Poor, Normal, Good based on GDP, SET index movements, and crisis events (Lehman collapse, Covid-19).

Scenario-Based LGD Estimation: PIT LGDs are estimated for three forward-looking scenarios:

Baseline (most likely)

Better (upside)

Worse (downside)


Smoothing and Blending: LGD outputs across scenarios are blended using weights (60% Baseline, 20% Better, 20% Worse) and smoothed using EWMA to ensure stability.

Final Output: Quarterly PIT LGD estimates that are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions.


1.3 Strengths and Limitations

Strengths:

Introduces forward-looking macroeconomic sensitivity absent in pure IRB models.

Statistically rigorous development of Macro Model (810 variable universe, stepwise selection, proportional odds validation).

Scenario-based estimates in line with IFRS9 stress testing principles.

Stability through EWMA smoothing avoids volatility in provisioning.


Limitations:

Macro tagging partly judgmental (manual crisis-based tagging).

Dependence on accuracy of macroeconomic forecasts from external sources.

Lack of portfolio default history, reliance on IRB performing LGD as anchor.

Assumes stable MEV-to-economy relationships over time.


1.4 Model Version Control

Model Name: IFRS9 LGD with Macro Framework

Version: V1.0

Date: 2025

1.5 Proposed Model Tier

Tier 2 – Significant impact on financial reporting (ECL provisioning) but not direct capital calculation model.

2. Model Background

2.1 Scope

Covers performing exposures requiring IFRS9 LGD estimation. Default data is insufficient; hence IRB LGD model is used as foundation, enhanced by a Macro Model for PIT calibration.

2.2 Model Stakeholders

Model Development: Risk Analytics

Model Owners: Credit Risk Management

Users: Finance (ECL calculation, provisioning), Regulatory Reporting teams

Review/Validation: Model Validation, Internal Audit, External Regulators


2.3 Model Interactions

Inputs: Historical MEVs, macroeconomic forecasts, IRB LGD outputs

Outputs: Quarterly PIT LGDs under three scenarios, final blended LGD for ECL

Interaction: Macro model → Liquidity horizon adjustment → LGD framework


2.4 Regulatory Requirements

IFRS9 requires use of forward-looking information and scenario-based projections of ECL.

Basel IRB framework provides foundation LGD estimation methodology, adjusted here for PIT purposes.

3. Overall Methodology

3.1 Model Flow Diagram

1. Collect MEV inputs.


2. Macro tagging: Define dependent variable (Economy State).


3. Develop Macro Model (Ordered Logit).


4. Predict quarterly economy state (Poor/Normal/Good).


5. Link economy state to liquidity horizons.


6. Estimate LGD under 3 scenarios (Baseline, Better, Worse).


7. Apply EWMA smoothing.


8. Blend scenario LGDs (60/20/20).


9. Final PIT LGD per quarter.



3.2 Model Theory

The Macro Model is built on an Ordered Logit Model due to the ordered nature of the dependent variable (Poor < Normal < Good).

The dependent variable was constructed using economic tagging based on historical crises and equity index movements.

Independent variables are transformations of macroeconomic indicators, including leads/lags to capture predictive relationships.

LGD estimation follows the IRB framework, with PIT calibration introduced by linking economy state to liquidity horizons and scenario-based projections.


3.3 Methodology Selection

Logistic regression rejected due to lack of ordinality.

Ordered Logit chosen as it allows natural ordering of states while maintaining proportional odds assumptions.

Scenario blending aligns with IFRS9 requirements for probability-weighted forward-looking estimates.


3.4 Methodology Assumptions and Limitations

Economy tagging captures systemic events reliably (Lehman collapse, Covid-19).

Relationships between MEVs and economy state are time-invariant.

Portfolio LGD behaves in a macro-sensitive manner consistent with liquidity horizon adjustments.
