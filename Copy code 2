This master file serves as a centralized repository for all finalized haircut calculations across various asset and sub-asset classes. It consolidates information from individual working Excel files, incorporating both our initially suggested haircuts and client comments for each asset class. Crucially, the master file also presents the finalized haircuts, which have been determined through a benchmarking process that refined our original recommendations. This comprehensive document provides a complete overview of the haircut methodology and its evolution for each asset class.
