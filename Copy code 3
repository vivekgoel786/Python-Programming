5. Model Development

5.1 Model Development Process

The model development process for the Macro Model was iterative and systematic, ensuring that only the most predictive and economically interpretable variables were retained. The major steps were:

Step 1: Variable Screening

The initial dataset consisted of 10 raw macroeconomic variables.

Through transformations (log, square-root, percentage change, log-difference, moving averages of 2, 3, and 4 quarters, and leads/lags up to 4 quarters), the predictor set expanded to 810 candidate variables.

A univariate Ordered Logit Model (OLM) was fitted for each variable against the dependent variable (Economy State).

Variables were screened through the following criteria:

Statistical significance of coefficients (p-value < 0.05) → reduced to 224 variables.

Model fit quality (Pseudo-R² ≥ 0.1) → reduced to 87 variables.

Proportional odds assumption checks (via Likelihood Ratio Tests and Brant Test) → reduced to 49 variables.

Model fit and interpretability trade-off → narrowed down to 7 high-performing predictors, representing diverse macroeconomic dimensions.



Step 2: Correlation & Multicollinearity Checks

Pairwise correlations among the shortlisted variables were assessed to avoid redundancy.

Only variables that were statistically strong, economically interpretable, and not highly correlated with each other were retained.

This ensured robustness of the multivariable OLM estimation and avoided unstable coefficient estimates.


Step 3: Multivariable OLM Estimation

All possible combinations of the 7 shortlisted variables were tested, resulting in 127 multivariable model runs.

Each model was evaluated on multiple statistical criteria:

Pseudo-R² (>0.32 for strong explanatory power).

Information criteria (AIC, BIC – lower values preferred).

Significance of all included predictors (p-value < 0.05).

Proportional odds assumption validity.

Absence of multicollinearity.


This process allowed balancing parsimony and performance.


Step 4: Final Model Selection

The final Macro Model retained 3 predictors (see section 5.3).

This choice ensured a model that was statistically strong, economically meaningful, and practically implementable, while avoiding overfitting.

5.2 Segmentation/Grouping

Unlike retail or wholesale credit models, no borrower-level segmentation was required since the Macro Model is designed at a systemic (economy-wide) level.

The model produces a quarterly classification of the economy state (Poor, Normal, Good), which is then applied uniformly across the Lombard loan portfolio.

This approach is justified given the homogeneous portfolio characteristics:

Small number of obligors (28 HNWI clients).

Zero historical defaults.

Loans backed by highly liquid collateral.


Therefore, segmentation at borrower or product level was unnecessary, and the macroeconomic driver approach sufficed.

5.3 Model Specification and Selection

The final specification of the Macro Model is an Ordered Logit Model (OLM) with 3 macroeconomic predictors, chosen for their predictive power, economic interpretability, and compliance with proportional odds assumptions:

1. UNEMP_RATE_lead2

Unemployment rate (in %) two quarters ahead.

Acts as a leading indicator of labor market stress and household consumption potential.



2. pct_change_GDP_lag1

Year-on-Year % change in GDP with a one-quarter lag.

Captures recent momentum in economic growth, linking directly to systemic performance.



3. pct_change_AVG_MONTHLY_WAGE_lead1

Year-on-Year % change in average monthly wage, one quarter ahead.

Reflects income growth and demand-side resilience, crucial for consumption and credit performance.




Model Performance Metrics:

Pseudo-R²: 0.3437 (strong explanatory power for macro models).

Accuracy Ratio: 78.79%.

F1 Score: 0.73, indicating balanced precision and recall across economy states.


This final model strikes a balance between statistical robustness, economic rationale, and forward-looking capability, making it well-suited for integration into the IFRS9 LGD framework.
