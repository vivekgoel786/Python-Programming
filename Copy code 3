4.3 Data Analysis

A comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) was undertaken to assess the quality, consistency, and predictive potential of the macroeconomic variables (MEVs) provided by the SCB EIC team. This stage was crucial to ensure that the inputs to the Macro Model were both statistically valid and economically meaningful.

Key steps in the analysis included:

1. Data Validation and Quality Checks

Each time series was checked for missing values, outliers, and structural breaks.

Formatting issues (e.g., inconsistent units or scales) were standardized to ensure comparability across variables.

Outliers were examined in the context of economic events (e.g., sharp GDP contractions during COVID-19) to distinguish genuine shocks from data errors.



2. Descriptive Statistics and Distributional Analysis

Summary statistics (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) were generated to understand the behavior of each MEV over time.

Correlation heatmaps were produced to identify potential redundancies and multicollinearity across predictors.



3. Stationarity and Time-Series Properties

Since MEVs are inherently time-series data, tests such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test were performed to check for stationarity.

Where non-stationarity was detected, transformations (e.g., log differences, percentage changes) were applied to stabilize the series.



4. Transformations and Feature Expansion

Multiple transformations were applied to generate additional predictive features:

Growth rates (YoY, QoQ)

Logarithmic differences

Smoothing via moving averages (2, 3, and 4-quarter windows)

Leads and lags (up to four quarters) to capture predictive and delayed relationships.


This process expanded the dataset from 10 original MEVs to 810 transformed features.



5. Univariate Screening

Each transformed variable was first tested individually using Ordered Logit models against the dependent variable (Economy State).

Performance criteria included significance of coefficients (p-value < 0.05), pseudo-R² thresholds (≥ 0.10), and validity of proportional odds assumptions.

This filtering reduced the feature set from 810 to a smaller pool of statistically strong and interpretable variables.




This structured analysis ensured that the predictors selected for the final Macro Model were both empirically robust and aligned with economic intuition, forming the foundation for subsequent multivariate modelling.
