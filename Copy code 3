Significance of AUM Buffer Ratio

The AUM Buffer Ratio was a derived variable created to assess a customer’s financial resilience and liquidity surplus in relation to their credit exposure. It is defined as:

\text{AUM Buffer Ratio} = \frac{\text{AUM (excluding loan proceeds) + Credit Limit}}{\text{Credit Limit}}

This ratio essentially captures how much liquid or near-liquid wealth a client holds in excess of their sanctioned credit limit. A higher value of the AUM Buffer Ratio indicates that the customer has substantial financial assets relative to their borrowing, which serves as a buffer in case of financial stress or adverse events.

Interpretation:

Ratio > 2.0: Indicates strong financial standing — client holds at least twice the assets compared to their credit limit, suggesting low dependency on borrowing.

Ratio ~1.0: Assets roughly equal the credit limit, reflecting moderate liquidity but less financial cushion.

Ratio < 1.0: Signals potential risk — client’s AUM excluding loan proceeds is less than the credit limit, raising concerns about over-leverage or insufficient unencumbered assets.


This metric was found to be particularly useful in differentiating clients with similar income profiles but varying liquidity strength, and played a critical role in enhancing the predictive power and financial interpretability of the model.
