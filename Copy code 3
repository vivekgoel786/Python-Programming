The choice of methodology was guided by the nature of the dependent variable, regulatory requirements under IFRS9, and the practical constraints of the portfolio.

A standard binary logistic regression was first considered but rejected because the dependent variable, Economy State, is not binary but ordinal with three ordered categories (Poor < Normal < Good). Treating these categories as nominal would ignore their inherent ranking, while collapsing them into a binary variable would result in significant information loss.

An Ordered Logit Model (OLM) was therefore selected as the core methodology for the Macro Model. The OLM is particularly suitable because:

It respects the ordinal structure of the dependent variable, ensuring that estimates capture the monotonic progression from Poor to Normal to Good.

It operates under the proportional odds assumption, which simplifies interpretation by assuming that the relationship between independent variables and the odds of being in a “higher” economic state is consistent across thresholds. This is a natural fit for modelling macroeconomic cycles.

It provides a parsimonious yet interpretable framework, allowing results to be communicated clearly to stakeholders and regulators.

It is statistically robust and widely used in credit risk modelling where ordered risk ratings or economic states are involved.


Once the Macro Model generates probabilities of economic states, these outputs are mapped into the LGD framework. To ensure compliance with IFRS9’s forward-looking, probability-weighted requirements, a scenario-based estimation approach is adopted:

Three macroeconomic scenarios—Baseline, Better, and Worse—are constructed using forecasts of macroeconomic variables (MEVs).

For each scenario, the Macro Model produces an economic state trajectory, which then drives LGD adjustments through changes in liquidity horizons.

The LGD outputs across scenarios are combined through probability-weighted blending (60% Baseline, 20% Better, 20% Worse), ensuring unbiased estimates that reflect expected conditions rather than single-point forecasts.


This combination of Ordered Logit regression with scenario blending strikes the right balance between statistical rigor and regulatory alignment. It ensures that the model:

Appropriately captures the ordered nature of economic cycles.

Produces forward-looking estimates consistent with IFRS9 requirements.

Provides a transparent and intuitive link between macroeconomic conditions and LGD outcomes in a portfolio where historical defaults are absent.
