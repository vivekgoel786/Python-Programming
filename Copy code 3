Once the macro model was finalized and validated, it was employed to generate forward-looking economic state predictions under three macroeconomic scenarios — Baseline, Better, and Worse — using the forecasted macroeconomic variables (MEVs) provided by SCB’s EIC team. These MEV forecasts span from March 2024 to December 2045, enabling long-term estimation of economic conditions for each quarter within the forecast horizon.

For each scenario, the Ordered Logit Macro Model produced a quarterly probability distribution across the three possible economic states (Poor, Normal, and Good). These probabilities represent the model’s forward-looking assessment of the likely economic condition for each future quarter.

The predicted economy states were then mapped to the LGD framework by linking them with the corresponding liquidity horizons and collateral characteristics within the Lombard portfolio. This ensured that LGD estimates were sensitive to expected macroeconomic variations while remaining consistent with the structural behavior of collateralized exposures.

To generate the Point-in-Time (PIT) LGD estimates, the following sequential steps were applied:

1. Scenario-wise LGD Estimation:
Using the forecasted economy states under each of the three scenarios, LGD estimates were computed for each quarter from 2007Q2 to 2045Q4, capturing both historical and projected periods.


2. Blending:
The scenario-specific LGDs were initially combined using probability weights derived from the macro model’s predicted probabilities, ensuring the final PIT LGDs reflected the relative likelihood of each macroeconomic path in line with IFRS 9’s probability-weighted requirement.


3. Smoothening:
To eliminate short-term noise and avoid abrupt quarter-on-quarter jumps, an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) technique was applied to the blended LGD series. This provided a smooth, stable, and interpretable LGD trajectory over time while retaining sensitivity to material macroeconomic changes.


4. Averaging with Scenario Weights (IFRS 9 Alignment):
Finally, in accordance with SCB’s current IFRS 9 practices, the PIT LGD estimates across the three scenarios were also averaged using fixed scenario weights of 60% Baseline, 20% Better, and 20% Worse. This step ensures consistency with regulatory provisioning frameworks while maintaining comparability with existing models and reporting structures.



The resulting PIT LGD term structure provides a forward-looking, probability-weighted, and smoothed series of LGD estimates through 2045. It successfully balances responsiveness to macroeconomic expectations with stability required for reliable credit loss estimation under IFRS 9.
