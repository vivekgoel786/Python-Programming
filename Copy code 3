The IFRS9 LGD model has been designed for a High-Net-Worth Individual (HNWI) Lombard loan portfolio of 28 customers, with no historical defaults. The model builds on the IRB Performing LGD framework and introduces a Macro Model overlay to incorporate forward-looking economic sensitivity.

The Macro Model, based on an Ordered Logit regression, classifies each quarter into Poor, Normal, or Good states using selected macroeconomic indicators. These states are then linked to liquidity horizons and collateral realizations, allowing LGD estimates to vary with economic conditions.

LGD is produced under Baseline, Better, and Worse scenarios, blended with IFRS9-compliant weights (60%-20%-20%), and further smoothed using EWMA to ensure stability. This approach ensures that LGD remains both forward-looking and scenario-driven, despite the absence of default history in the portfolio.
