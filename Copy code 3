A key strength of the IFRS9 LGD model lies in its integration of forward-looking macroeconomic sensitivity, something that is often absent in traditional IRB-based approaches. By embedding a Macro Model that forecasts economic states using robust macroeconomic indicators, the framework ensures that LGD estimates are responsive to changes in the broader economic environment. This enhances compliance with IFRS9 requirements, which explicitly mandate consideration of forward-looking information and multiple scenarios. The development process of the Macro Model itself was statistically rigorous, involving a comprehensive screening of more than 800 transformed variables, proportional odds testing, and careful selection of predictors with strong explanatory power and economic rationale. This ensures the model is both empirically sound and interpretable. Another important strength is the use of scenario-based estimates—Baseline, Better, and Worse—blended through probability weights, which provides a balanced view of potential future outcomes. Finally, smoothing via EWMA helps reduce volatility, making the LGD outputs more stable and operationally practical for quarterly reporting.

On the other hand, certain limitations must be acknowledged. The macro tagging process, which defines the dependent variable for the Macro Model, includes judgmental elements such as crisis-based classification of Poor periods (e.g., Lehman collapse, Covid-19). While this captures major systemic shocks, it introduces a degree of subjectivity. The model’s reliance on external macroeconomic forecasts also makes it vulnerable to forecasting errors, which can directly affect LGD estimates. Another limitation is that the portfolio itself has little to no default history; as a result, the model leverages the IRB performing LGD framework as a base and overlays macroeconomic sensitivity rather than being derived from empirical default data. This reliance may limit its accuracy in highly stressed or unprecedented environments. Moreover, the approach assumes stable long-term relationships between macroeconomic indicators and economic state classifications, which may not always hold true if structural changes occur in the economy.
