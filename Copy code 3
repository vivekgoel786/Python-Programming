The scope of this model covers the estimation of IFRS9-compliant Loss Given Default (LGD) for a specialized portfolio of Lombard loans, consisting of 28 customers. This portfolio is classified as High-Net-Worth Individual (HNWI) lending, where borrowers pledge high-quality, marketable securities as collateral to secure credit facilities. Given the affluent nature of the client base and the high degree of collateralization, the portfolio has historically exhibited zero defaults. While this feature highlights the inherently low credit risk of Lombard loans, it also creates a modeling challenge, as there is no direct default and recovery history to empirically derive LGD parameters.

To address this limitation, the LGD framework is anchored in the IRB Performing LGD methodology, which provides a regulatory foundation, but it is further enhanced with a Macro Model to capture forward-looking economic sensitivity in line with IFRS9 requirements. The Macro Model predicts the quarterly state of the economy (Poor, Normal, or Good) using macroeconomic variables and links this output to adjustments in liquidity horizons and recovery assumptions within the LGD framework. This ensures that PIT LGD estimates reflect not just baseline conditions but also potential adverse or favorable macroeconomic scenarios.

The need for macroeconomic sensitivity is particularly relevant in the context of Lombard lending. Although these loans are collateralized by liquid financial assets, the value of the pledged collateral is closely tied to financial market performance and can deteriorate significantly during periods of market stress. For instance, a systemic downturn (e.g., financial crisis or pandemic-driven market shock) could erode collateral values and extend liquidation horizons, thereby increasing realized LGDs despite the secured nature of the exposure. Conversely, during favorable market conditions, recovery rates are likely to remain high and liquidation timelines shorter.

Accordingly, the model delivers quarterly PIT LGD estimates under three macroeconomic scenarios—Baseline, Better, and Worse—which are blended using prescribed scenario weights to generate the final IFRS9-compliant LGD. While the current scope is limited to the 28-customer HNWI Lombard loan portfolio, the methodology has been designed to remain scalable and adaptable to other similar portfolios where defaults are rare, but exposure to macro-financial shocks is material.
