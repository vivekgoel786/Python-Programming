5.4.2 Final Model Calibration

The calibration of the final Ordered Logit Macro Model involved several diagnostic checks and adjustments to ensure compliance with econometric assumptions, interpretability of predictors, and robustness of results.

A. Variable Normalization

All predictor variables were normalized (mean-centered and scaled by standard deviation) prior to model estimation.

This step ensured comparability across variables with different units (e.g., unemployment rate in %, GDP in THB growth %, wages in THB).

Normalization also facilitated more stable coefficient estimates and made the relative magnitude of betas interpretable in terms of standard deviation changes.


For reference, the following descriptive statistics were used in scaling:

Variable	Mean	Standard Deviation	Interpretation of Scaling

UNEMP_RATE_lead2	X̄1	σ1	A one-unit increase corresponds to 1 SD rise in expected unemployment rate (2 quarters ahead).
pct_change_GDP_lag1	X̄2	σ2	A one-unit increase corresponds to 1 SD rise in GDP growth momentum (YoY, 1-quarter lag).
pct_change_AVG_MONTHLY_WAGE_lead1	X̄3	σ3	A one-unit increase corresponds to 1 SD rise in wage growth expectation (1-quarter ahead).


(Insert actual mean and SD values here when available.)

B. Proportional Odds Assumption Testing

A core assumption of the Ordered Logit Model is the Proportional Odds Assumption (POA), which requires that the relationship between predictors and the odds of being in a higher vs. lower category is constant across thresholds.

This was tested using:

Likelihood Ratio (LR) Test statistic = 5.8390, which was statistically insignificant, indicating that the POA holds.

Brant Test, which further confirmed that the proportional odds assumption was not violated for any of the included predictors.


Hence, the Ordered Logit framework is valid, and a more complex alternative (e.g., Generalized Ordered Logit) was unnecessary.


C. Multicollinearity Diagnostics

Multicollinearity was assessed using Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) for the three final predictors:


Variable	VIF	Interpretation

UNEMP_RATE_lead2	1.3148	Very low → indicates little to no multicollinearity.
pct_change_GDP_lag1	1.1802	Very low → predictors are independent.
pct_change_AVG_MONTHLY_WAGE_lead1	1.1384	Very low → confirms no correlation issue.


Since all VIF values are well below the standard threshold of 5 (and even below 2), multicollinearity is not a concern. This ensures that the estimated coefficients are stable, reliable, and interpretable.


D. Calibration Summary

The model satisfies all statistical and econometric requirements:

Variables normalized → comparability across predictors.

No multicollinearity (VIF < 1.5).

Proportional odds assumption confirmed (LR statistic insignificant, Brant Test satisfied).


Therefore, the final model is considered well-calibrated and suitable for forward-looking projections of economy state classification.
