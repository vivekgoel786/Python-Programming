Following the development, calibration, and prototype finalization of the PD model for the HNWI portfolios, it was recognized that certain qualitative, event-driven risk considerations were not fully captured in the model’s statistical and expert-judgment framework. To address this, an overlay adjustment mechanism was introduced to incorporate additional factors that can materially influence a customer’s credit risk profile.

Additional Factors Considered

The following binary (Yes/No) factors were identified based on business experience, RM inputs, and portfolio monitoring insights:

1. Past Performance – Historical repayment discipline, arrears history, and adherence to contractual terms.


2. Legal – Any ongoing or past legal disputes, litigations, or regulatory actions involving the customer.


3. Margin Call – Instances where the customer has breached collateral coverage thresholds, triggering margin calls.


4. Other Factors – Any other significant adverse developments affecting the customer’s financial stability or reputation, as identified by the RM or BU.



Each factor was classified into High Risk or Low Risk categories based on its potential severity and impact.

Adjustment Matrix

A downgrade matrix was developed to systematically translate the presence of these factors into model score adjustments. The approach ensures consistency and transparency in applying qualitative overrides.

Number of High-Risk Factors Present	Downgrade Applied

0 or 1	No downgrade
2	2-notch downgrade
3	3-notch downgrade
4	4-notch downgrade


If low-risk factors are present, they are monitored but do not automatically trigger a downgrade unless accompanied by high-risk factors as per the matrix.

Rationale

This overlay serves as a prudential safeguard, ensuring that customers with otherwise strong model-predicted scores are not overrated if there are material qualitative concerns. It reflects the Bank’s risk appetite and aligns the final rating closer to the true underlying credit risk.
