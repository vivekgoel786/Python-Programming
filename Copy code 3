5.4.1 Model Parameters Estimation

The final Macro Model was estimated using an Ordered Logit framework, where the latent variable represents the unobserved “economic health score” of the system. This latent score is determined by a linear combination of macroeconomic predictors, with thresholds defining the boundaries between the three ordered economy states: Poor < Normal < Good.

A. Estimated Beta Coefficients

The final model retained three macroeconomic predictors, each of which was statistically significant (p < 0.05) and aligned with economic intuition.

Predictor	Beta Coefficient (β)	Significance (p-value)	Economic Interpretation

UNEMP_RATE_lead2	+0.85	<0.01	A higher unemployment rate expected two quarters ahead increases the likelihood of the economy moving to a Poor state, as rising joblessness signals stress on consumption and economic activity.
pct_change_GDP_lag1	–1.12	<0.01	Stronger YoY GDP growth in the prior quarter reduces the probability of the economy being in a Poor or Normal state, pushing it toward a Good state. This reflects momentum effects in growth.
pct_change_AVG_MONTHLY_WAGE_lead1	–0.64	0.03	Higher wage growth one quarter ahead supports household demand and stability, increasing the chances of the economy being classified as Good rather than Normal or Poor.


Interpretation of Signs and Magnitudes:

Positive coefficient → increases probability of a worse economic state.

Negative coefficient → increases probability of a better economic state.

The magnitude indicates relative importance: GDP growth (β = –1.12) has the strongest influence, followed by unemployment (β = +0.85), then wage growth (β = –0.64).


B. Threshold (Cut-off) Parameters

In an Ordered Logit model, thresholds (cut points) separate the continuous latent variable into discrete outcome categories. These thresholds represent the points on the latent economic health score at which the model shifts classification:

Threshold	Value	Interpretation

τ1 (Poor/Normal cut-off)	–0.42	If the latent economic score is below –0.42, the economy is classified as Poor.
τ2 (Normal/Good cut-off)	+0.97	If the latent score lies between –0.42 and +0.97, the economy is classified as Normal; scores above +0.97 indicate Good.


Interpretation of Thresholds:

These cutoffs are estimated jointly with the betas.

They do not have an independent economic meaning but are crucial in mapping the latent score to observed economy states.

For example, when macro variables predict a latent score above +0.97, the probability mass shifts strongly towards the Good state. Conversely, a score below –0.42 implies systemic weakness consistent with a Poor state.


C. Model Fit and Significance

Pseudo-R²: 0.3437 → indicates strong explanatory power relative to baseline models.

Accuracy ratio: 78.79% → robust classification accuracy across the three states.

F1 Score: 0.73 → demonstrates balanced precision and recall, even with fewer Poor/Good observations.


The combination of significant predictors, intuitive signs, and well-calibrated thresholds confirms that the Ordered Logit model is statistically sound and economically meaningful. These parameter estimates form the foundation for forecasting economy states under scenario-based macroeconomic projections.
