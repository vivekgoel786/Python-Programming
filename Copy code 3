1. Model Performance
the model continues to perform well	for PBL with low PSI of 0.042 indicating strong stability in predict power
for LBL, PSI is higher at 0.363 however, this should be interpreted with a caution due to limited sample with one yr data

2. Rating transition analysis
	the matrix indicates movements of clients from mid range ratings to both extremes of the master scale
	these are reflective of change in observed behaviours of business dynamics especially in small and concentrated Lombard sample

4. Drivers of PSI shift in LBL
the higher PSI primarily stems from shifts in factor distributions, particularly
	AUM
	AUM Buffer ratio
	KWR
	
	these shifts appear to be more data driven than model driven, likely reflecting changing portfolio characteristics 
	rather than instability in the model itself


	
4. key metrices to support model soundness
	Avg PD - remains within acceptable bounds, suggesting that the overall risk profile is preserved
	
	KT has shown improvement indicating better rank iordering of risky clients
	
	AR is strong, reinforcing the model's discriminatory power
	
	HHI has slighly declined as there is no observation in MS-12 like before, otherwise it does not compromise concentration risk insights
	

5. Small sample
	small datasets is inherently sensitive to even minor distributional changes. The elevated PSI is likely an artifact of small volatility not model instability
	
	as more LBL clients join in, we expect more robust and representative validation metrices
	
	

conclusion 
despite PSI shift in LBL model remains stable overall. specially in core metrices like rank ordering, KT, avg pD, AR
ongoing monitoring and periodic validation, especially as LBL portfolio grows, will ensure continued alignment with portfolio behaviour
