Subject: Sharing "Model Prototype" Excel File with Sheet-wise Details

Dear [Client's Name],

I hope you're doing well.

Please find attached the Excel file titled "Model Prototype" for your reference. The workbook has been structured and color-coded for clarity, with orange tabs representing LBL, blue for PBL, and green for the consolidated sheets. Below is a summary of each sheet for your convenience:

1. Final Pds
This sheet includes a consolidated list of 73 customers along with all relevant factor data.

Each factor (e.g., Age) is represented with three columns: Age_factor, Age_score, and Age_risk_rank.

Additionally, you will find the PBL and LBL model scores, MS Rating, and the final PDs.



2. LBL_Prototype and PBL_Prototype
These are interactive templates where you can select values for each factor. Based on the selections, the sheet auto-calculates the model score and the corresponding rating.


3. factor_answers_LBL and factor_answers_PBL
These sheets contain a detailed list of factors along with the possible answer options, associated scores, and risk rankings.


4. LBL_WEIGHTS and PBL_WEIGHTS
These sheets provide the final weights assigned to each factor. These weights were derived through a combination of optimization techniques and expert judgment from the Credit Officer (CO).


5. lbl_MODELscore and PBL_MODELscore
These contain the individual LBL and PBL customer data, with the respective model scores and the MS Rating derived from them.


6. lbl_dist and PBL_DIST
These are the manual calibration sheets mapping the model scores to the master rating scale.

Includes the distribution, average PD, HHI values, and corresponding MS-Ratings.




Please let us know if you have any questions or would like to discuss any part of the file in detail.
