4.4 Model Development Data

The final dataset used for model development was derived from the processed and transformed macroeconomic variables covering the period March 2006 to March 2024 (73 quarters). This timeframe was selected as it spans both normal macroeconomic conditions and major systemic stress events (Global Financial Crisis 2008–09, COVID-19 pandemic 2020–21), ensuring that the dependent variable reflects sufficient variability for robust model training.

Dependent Variable (Economy State)
The dependent variable was constructed through economic tagging, combining historical crisis events with equity market performance to assign each quarter into one of three ordered economic states.

Economy State	Number of Quarters	% of Sample	Key Events / Conditions

Poor	11	15%	Global Financial Crisis (2008–09), COVID-19 Pandemic (2020–21)
Normal	49	67%	Stable periods with moderate equity index growth
Good	13	18%	High-growth periods exceeding SET Index threshold (6.48% QoQ change)


This distribution is imbalanced toward the Normal class, which aligns with real-world economic cycles where extreme stress or boom conditions are less frequent.

Independent Variables (Final Predictors)
The original dataset of ~10 macroeconomic indicators was expanded into 810 candidate predictors through transformations (growth rates, log differences, moving averages, leads/lags). Following rigorous univariate and multivariate screening, three predictors were retained for the final Ordered Logit Model:

Variable	Transformation	Economic Rationale

Unemployment Rate	Lead by 2 quarters	Anticipates labor market stress; early warning of downturns.
YoY GDP Growth	Lag by 1 quarter	Captures momentum from prior quarter’s output; reflects economic inertia.
YoY Average Monthly Wage Growth	Lead by 1 quarter	Forward-looking indicator of household income, spending power, and consumption trends.


These predictors were selected for their statistical significance, ability to satisfy the proportional odds assumption, and their clear linkage to macroeconomic theory.

Sample Size and Structure

Observations: 73 quarters.

Predictors: 3 selected MEVs (post-transformation and selection).

Dependent variable: Economy State (ordinal, 3 levels).


By combining a well-tagged dependent variable with systematically filtered macroeconomic predictors, the development dataset provided a statistically robust and economically intuitive foundation for estimating the Ordered Logit Macro Model.
