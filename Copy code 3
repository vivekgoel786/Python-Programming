D. Threshold Parameters

The Ordered Logit framework estimated two thresholds on the latent economic score:

τ1 (Poor/Normal cut-off) = –0.42 → Below this value, the economy is classified as Poor.

τ2 (Normal/Good cut-off) = +0.97 → Between –0.42 and +0.97, the state is Normal; above +0.97, the state is Good.


These thresholds provide the decision boundaries for converting the continuous latent score into discrete economy states.

E. Integration into IFRS9 LGD Framework

The calibrated Macro Model serves as the driver of scenario-dependent LGD estimates:

1. Economy State Prediction

For each quarter from Mar 2006 to Dec 2065, the Ordered Logit model classifies the state (Poor, Normal, Good) using SCB’s forecasted macroeconomic variables under Baseline, Better, and Worse scenarios.



2. Mapping to LGD Adjustments

Each economy state is linked to liquidity horizon adjustments within the IRB Performing LGD framework.

Poor states → longer liquidation horizons, higher LGD.

Good states → shorter liquidation horizons, lower LGD.



3. Scenario Blending (IFRS9 Requirement)

LGD estimates are blended across scenarios with regulatory-compliant weights:

Baseline (60%)

Better (20%)

Worse (20%)


This ensures LGDs are probability-weighted and forward-looking, in line with IFRS9.



4. Smoothing with EWMA

To reduce quarter-to-quarter volatility, LGD series are smoothed using an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA).

This preserves responsiveness to macro shifts while ensuring stability for capital planning and provisioning.




F. Calibration Outcome

The final model is statistically sound (valid POA, no multicollinearity, significant predictors).

Economically, the model captures labor market, growth, and wage dynamics as the key drivers of systemic risk.

Practically, it provides a structured way to generate Point-in-Time (PIT) LGD estimates that incorporate macroeconomic sensitivity, scenario diversity, and smoothing for operational use.
