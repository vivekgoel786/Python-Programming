The primary data used in model development was macroeconomic time-series data provided by SCB’s Economic Intelligence Center (EIC) team. This dataset forms the backbone of the Macro Model, as the objective is to forecast the state of the economy (Poor, Normal, Good) based on macroeconomic dynamics and subsequently link these forecasts to LGD estimation.

Source: SCB EIC team (internal research division).

Frequency: Quarterly.

Time Period Covered: March 2006 – March 2024, providing a total of 73 quarterly observations.

Initial Scope: The data was initially shared for the Baseline scenario only, to support exploratory analysis and model development.


The dataset consisted of multiple macroeconomic variables (MEVs) that represent key dimensions of Thailand’s economy, including growth, consumption, employment, inflation, and financial conditions. These variables were considered as potential predictors for the economy state classification model.

(This table will list all MEVs such as GDP, Unemployment Rate, CPI, Average Monthly Wage, Farm Income Index, Minimum Loan Rate, Real Private Consumption, Nominal GDP Growth, Motor Vehicle Sales, etc.)

During data processing, steps were undertaken to ensure data quality and usability, including handling of missing values, formatting consistency, and alignment of time periods across all series. Various transformations (e.g., growth rates, log differences, moving averages, leads, and lags) were applied to expand the predictive feature set and capture both contemporaneous and forward-looking economic effects.

Once the Macro Model was finalized, the EIC team provided extended macroeconomic forecasts up to December 2065 under three scenarios—Baseline, Worse, and Better. These long-term MEV forecasts serve as inputs into the Macro Model to generate projected economy states under each scenario, which are subsequently incorporated into the LGD framework for IFRS9-compliant, forward-looking estimation.
