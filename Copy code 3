🔑 Motivation

Ordinal regression models (e.g., probit, logit, cumulative link) are widely used in medicine, social sciences, and economics.

Unlike linear regression, there has been a lack of effective residual-based diagnostics for ordinal outcomes.

Traditional residuals (like Pearson or SBS residuals) have limitations:

Depend on arbitrary category labels.

Discrete distributions → hard to interpret.

Show unusual patterns even when models are correctly specified.

🧩 Proposed Method: Surrogate Residuals

Introduces a continuous surrogate variable (S) that represents the ordinal outcome.

Defines residuals as .

This approach transforms ordinal outcomes into a continuous diagnostic framework.



---

📊 Key Properties

1. Null distribution of residuals is explicit and invariant to covariates (unlike SBS residuals).


2. Symmetry and constant variance under correct model specification.


3. Monotonicity: residuals preserve ordering of categories.


4. Residuals resemble those in linear regression, enabling the use of:

QQ plots

Residual vs. covariate plots

Density plots

Goodness-of-fit measures

🛠 Diagnostic Power

Surrogate residuals can detect:

Mean structure misspecification (e.g., missing nonlinear terms).

Incorrect link function (e.g., probit vs. skewed link).

Heteroscedasticity (non-constant variance).

Proportionality assumption violations in ordinal models.

Mixed populations / missing covariates (bimodal residual distributions).

🧪 Applications

Demonstrated through simulations.

Applied to the SAGE genetic study on alcohol dependence:

Detected need to adjust for age and study effects.

Helped refine the model, improving goodness-of-fit.

📌 Contributions

Provides a general residual framework for ordinal regression, with better theoretical properties than earlier methods (like SBS residuals).

Extends naturally to binary models and more general categorical models (via jittering).

Offers diagnostic insights beyond a single p-value test, guiding model improvement.

✅ In Summary

The paper introduces surrogate residuals as a powerful new diagnostic tool for ordinal regression models. These residuals behave like continuous residuals, enabling familiar diagnostic techniques and offering deeper insights into model misspecification (mean, link, variance, proportionality, covariate effects). Compared to older methods, surrogate residuals are more robust, interpretable, and practically useful.
