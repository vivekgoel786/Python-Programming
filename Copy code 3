The IFRS9 LGD model is designed for a low-default HNWI Lombard loan portfolio, where traditional historical default/recovery-based LGD modelling is not feasible due to the absence of observed defaults. To overcome this challenge, the model leverages a two-layered theoretical framework:

1. Macro Model (Economy State Classification)
The first layer of the model involves constructing a Macro Model to classify the state of the economy on a quarterly basis into three ordered categories: Poor, Normal, and Good. This classification reflects the recognition that economic downturns typically lengthen collateral liquidation horizons and reduce recovery rates, while favorable conditions shorten liquidation periods and improve recoveries.

Choice of Model: An Ordered Logit Model (OLM) was selected because the dependent variable (Economy State) is inherently ordinal in nature, with Poor < Normal < Good. This approach ensures that parameter estimates respect the monotonic structure of economic states.

Dependent Variable Construction: The Economy State was defined through macro tagging, combining (a) historically significant crisis events (e.g., Global Financial Crisis 2008–09, COVID-19 pandemic 2020–21) and (b) movements in the SET equity index. Specifically, quarters with equity index growth below the 80th percentile threshold (6.48% QoQ) were tagged as Normal, while extreme downturn periods were tagged as Poor and strong growth periods as Good. This tagging created a historical economic classification over 73 quarters (Mar 2006 – Mar 2024).

Independent Variables: The predictors consist of transformations of key macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP, unemployment, CPI, wages, farm income, interest rates, and consumption. To capture dynamic relationships, these indicators were transformed through lags, leads, differences, growth rates, and moving averages, resulting in over 800 candidate predictors. Rigorous variable selection was applied, ensuring statistical significance, proportional odds validity, and economic interpretability. The final macro model includes Unemployment Rate (lead 2), GDP growth (lag 1), and Average Monthly Wage growth (lead 1), offering robust predictive power (Pseudo-R² = 0.34, Accuracy ≈ 79%).



2. Linkage to LGD Estimation (IRB + PIT Calibration)
The second layer of the framework connects macroeconomic states to LGD estimation. Since Lombard loans are secured against marketable collateral, LGD is highly sensitive to liquidity horizons and market conditions. The IRB Performing LGD framework is therefore used as the structural foundation, while PIT adjustments are introduced through the Macro Model:

Liquidity Horizon Adjustment: In Poor states, stressed market conditions imply longer liquidation timelines and reduced recovery values, resulting in higher LGD. Conversely, Good states assume quicker realization and lower LGD.

Scenario-Based Estimation: In line with IFRS9, three macroeconomic scenarios (Baseline, Better, Worse) are projected using MEV forecasts, each mapped into economic states via the Macro Model. Separate LGD paths are derived for each scenario.

Blending and PIT LGD: The scenario LGDs are blended using IFRS9-compliant weights (60% Baseline, 20% Better, 20% Worse). To prevent excessive quarter-to-quarter volatility, the final PIT LGD estimates are smoothed using an Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) process.



3. Conceptual Integration
The model thus integrates economic theory (macro-financial linkages), statistical modelling (Ordered Logit regression), and regulatory frameworks (IRB and IFRS9). This integration allows the bank to derive forward-looking LGD estimates that are:

Risk-sensitive, reflecting the state of the economy.

Scenario-based, aligning with IFRS9 ECL requirements.

Practical for low-default portfolios, where historical LGD data is insufficient.




In essence, the theory behind this model rests on the idea that macroeconomic cycles drive credit loss severity through their impact on collateral liquidity and realizations. By formally linking macroeconomic indicators to LGD estimation through an ordered-state framework, the model creates a robust, transparent, and compliant approach to loss forecasting in HNWI Lombard portfolios.
