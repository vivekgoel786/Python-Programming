Despite the presence of autocorrelation and non-stationarity in the predictor variables, the use of these variables in an ordered logistic regression framework is statistically justifiable, provided the following points:


---

âœ… 1. Predictors Are Not the Outcome of Interest

The modelâ€™s objective is not to forecast the time series themselves (GDP, unemployment, or wages) but to model their relationship with an ordinal outcome (Economy_State_dummy).

Therefore, the traditional concerns around non-stationarity (like spurious regression in OLS) are less critical, particularly when:

The dependent variable is categorical, not continuous

The focus is not on causal time series dynamics but classification




---

âœ… 2. Classification Models (Like Ordered Logit) Donâ€™t Require Stationary Predictors

Unlike time series models (e.g., ARIMA, VAR), classification models do not assume stationarity of predictors.

As long as the relationships between predictors and the ordinal outcome are stable and consistent across the dataset, the model can generalize well.

Stationarity becomes more of an issue if your model is:

Used for forecasting future values

Sensitive to temporal drift in predictor distributions




---

âœ… 3. No Evidence of Overfitting or Misspecification

The model shows strong performance:

Accuracy: 78.79%

Macro F1 Score: 73%


All standard assumptions for ordinal logistic regression are satisfied:

Proportional odds assumption

No multicollinearity

Independence of observations


This indicates that the non-stationarity or autocorrelation in predictors has not led to model instability, overfitting, or inflated metrics.



---

âœ… 4. Pre-Transformed Predictors Mitigate Temporal Leakage

Youâ€™ve already used lagged and transformed versions (e.g., QoQ % change in GDP), which partially reduce trend and autocorrelation concerns.

While ADF and Ljung-Box show residual issues, the transformations help reduce their practical impact on model interpretation and performance.



---

âœ… 5. Temporal Dependency in Predictors Doesnâ€™t Violate Model Assumptions

Autocorrelation in predictors does not violate any assumptions of ordinal logistic regression, as long as:

The observations are independent (which you've ensured)

The predictors are not collinear


Hence, autocorrelation in GDP, unemployment rate, or wages doesn't impair the modelâ€™s statistical validity â€” though it may affect economic interpretability over time.

ðŸ“Œ Final Justification Statement

> Although the predictor variables (GDP, unemployment rate, and average wage) exhibit autocorrelation and non-stationarity as indicated by ACF, Ljung-Box, and ADF tests, these characteristics do not violate the assumptions of an ordered logistic regression model. The model satisfies all core assumptions â€” including proportional odds, no multicollinearity, and independence of observations â€” and demonstrates strong predictive performance (accuracy: 78.79%, macro F1 score: 73%). Since the predictors are not being forecasted but are used to explain an ordinal outcome, their autocorrelation and non-stationarity do not compromise model validity. Additionally, the use of lagged and differenced forms (e.g., QoQ % change in GDP) further mitigates temporal dependency concerns. Therefore, the model remains robust and interpretable despite the presence of these time-series properties in the explanatory variables.
