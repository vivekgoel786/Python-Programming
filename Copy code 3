The quality and reliability of the Macro Model depend heavily on the assumptions made in defining the dependent variable (Economy State) and selecting macroeconomic predictors. While care has been taken to ensure economic consistency and statistical robustness, certain assumptions and limitations remain inherent in the data inputs:

1. Subjectivity in Economic Tagging

The tagging of the dependent variable into Poor, Normal, and Good states is partly based on judgemental thresholds and crisis triggers.

For example, systemic stress periods such as the Global Financial Crisis (2008–09) and the COVID-19 pandemic (2020–21) were manually classified as Poor states.

While this approach ensures alignment with observable economic reality, it introduces an element of subjectivity that could affect reproducibility if different tagging criteria were applied.



2. Equity Market Threshold for “Good” State

The distinction between Good and Normal states was operationalized using the 80th percentile threshold of SET Index quarterly returns (6.48%).

Quarters with SET Index growth above this level were tagged as Good.

This rule is simple and transparent but assumes that equity market performance is a sufficient proxy for broader economic prosperity, which may not always capture underlying fundamentals.



3. Limited Dependent Variable Observations

The dataset spans 73 quarters, of which only 11 are tagged as Poor and 13 as Good, leaving a dominant majority of 49 Normal states.

While the Ordered Logit framework is well-suited for ordinal data, the relatively small number of Poor and Good observations could reduce the robustness of coefficient estimates for these categories.



4. Assumptions Around Macro Variables

Independent variables were derived from macroeconomic indicators provided by the SCB EIC team. It is assumed that these indicators are accurately measured, timely, and consistent over the full sample period.

Forecasted values of the same variables (till Dec 2065) are also assumed to reflect plausible scenarios (baseline, better, worse) and serve as valid inputs for forward-looking model application.



5. Scope Limitation to Lombard Loans Portfolio

Since the portfolio under consideration is a High-Net-Worth Individual (HNWI) Lombard Loan portfolio with zero defaults, the tagging framework indirectly incorporates macro sensitivity instead of relying on realized default events.

This makes the model highly relevant for stress testing and scenario-based projections, but less directly validated against actual historical default data.




In summary, while the tagging framework and input transformations provide a structured and economically defensible basis for model development, users of the model should remain aware of the subjectivity in tagging, equity market reliance, and limited Poor/Good sample size, all of which may influence the interpretation of results.
