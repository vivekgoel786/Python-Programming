QMM (Quantile Mean Matching) vs. Platt Scaling

Both Quantile Mean Matching (QMM) and Platt Scaling are techniques used for calibrating probabilistic models, but they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.


---

1. Platt Scaling

Platt Scaling is a logistic regression-based method for calibrating probabilistic outputs of classification models. It takes the raw model scores and maps them to calibrated probabilities.

How It Works

Fits a logistic regression model on the output scores from the classifier.

The new probability is given by:


P(y = 1 | x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{(Ax + B)}}

where A and B are parameters learned from validation data.

Use Cases

Used primarily for binary classification tasks.

Works well when the classifier outputs scores that are monotonically related to the true probabilities (e.g., SVMs, neural networks).


Pros

Simple and effective for binary classifiers.

Works well when the classifier already produces well-ordered scores.


Cons

Limited to binary classification (for multi-class, needs extensions like one-vs-rest).

Assumes sigmoid shape, which may not always fit the data well.

2. Quantile Mean Matching (QMM)

Quantile Mean Matching is a non-parametric calibration method often used in weather forecasting and climate modeling to adjust model outputs.

How It Works

Takes the empirical quantiles of the modelâ€™s predicted scores and matches them to observed values.

Instead of fitting a parametric function (like Platt Scaling), it adjusts predictions based on the observed distribution.


Use Cases

Used in forecasting and regression models, where predicted distributions need to be aligned with real-world observations.

Suitable for correcting biases in probabilistic forecasts.


Pros

Works for both regression and probabilistic classification models.

Non-parametric (no assumptions about the shape of the probability distribution).

Effective when the predicted and observed distributions differ in scale but have a consistent shape.


Cons

Computationally expensive, especially with large datasets.

Less effective when there is little data for quantile estimation.

Which One to Use?

If you have a binary classification model with raw scores, use Platt Scaling.

If you need to calibrate a regression model or probabilistic forecast, use QMM.
